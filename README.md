# NoSleep
Keeps PC from going into sleep/lock mode.
NoSleep keeps your PC from going into sleep/lock in the case that the Active Directory Global Settings are set to something stupid like 2 minutes and you are one of those people who actually research and READ more than you CLICK.

NoSleep works by producing a CAPS LOCK keystroke approximately every 90 seconds--it actually produces two in rapid succession so as to leave the caps state where you had it.  If you are actively typing at the time it fires, it can produce (usually only) one character that is in CAPS.  Also comes with a install project in the solution which was used to create the install package.
